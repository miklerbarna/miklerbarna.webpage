                    In our word, food has become a wildly available resource, therefore we started to eat unhealthy foods. 
                    Most of the harmful food components are a result of eating processed and “bad” meals.
                    These lack the necessary nutrients and macros for our daily lives. Moreover, we waste more food than ever before, harming the environment in the process.
                    This type of eating takes a toll on the body and slowly kills us. 
                    Because of this, we as a species figured out many different type of eating habits, which eventually became diets.
                    Nowadays, there are more than a <b>100+ diets</b>, some are better than others. This site will focus on some of the most known ones.
                    We often differentiate these three diets, because they are more of a lifestyle than a diet.

                <h2>Why are bad foods bad?</h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the processed foods contain too much salt (or sugar), and unhealthy fats.
                    They are packed with artificial ingredients and lack nutritional value.
                    Eating too much of these foods can cause:

                    We can see that eating too much processed and fast foods are <b>not optional for the body.</b>
                    We don’t have to abstain completely from all form of processed foods, but it is important to follow a diet to ensure that our bodies are in a good condition.

                <h2>The importance of a good diet</h2>
                <p>
                    Sticking to an eating custom is a must for someone, who wants to live a long life.
                    With these diets, we can live without having to worry about our body’s limit or risking any health factors that come from bad eating habits.
                    It is crucial to find a diet that we can stick to, otherwise we might slip up and get discouraged for life.
                    A good diet also helps you control your weight, improves your mental health and even gives you more energy for the day.
                    Every diet must include the proper amount of vitamins, minerals and macronutrients. 
                    Diets can be different based on their viewpoint of macronutrients (E.g.: Ketogenetic diet).
                    Drinking enough water is also something that we must look out for.

                        I have been doing fitness for years and I practice the <i>Vegetarian Diet</i> and sometimes the <i>Keto diet</i> too.
